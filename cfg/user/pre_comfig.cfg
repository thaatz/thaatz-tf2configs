// this runs before mastercomfig does
// so we use this to change directx leve instead of the -dxlevel launch command, then removing then restarting tf2. we can just use the cvars and this script to automate it all

// SET DX LEVEL
//mat_dxlevel 90 // i dont think you really need the -dxlevel 90 launch option, i think you can just use this cvar
mat_dxlevel 100  // 100 to autodetect based on hardware

// RESOLUTION SETTINGS
mat_setvideomode 1920 1080 1 //set 1920x1080 windowed

// MASTERCOMFIG PRESET
// https://docs.mastercomfig.com/en/latest/customization/custom_configs/#changing-your-preset
//preset=medium-high // if you want to change to something else
