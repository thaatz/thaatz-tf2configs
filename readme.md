## mastercomfig
- this script will just download whatever the latest mastercomfig is. at the moment i have not found a method of determining the modified date of the files hosted on github.com without fully downloading first so the script does not bother to check to see if your files are already up to date and instead just downloads whatever the latest release is.
- might be useful for figuring out what the latest release is
