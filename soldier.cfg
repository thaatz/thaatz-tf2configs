// Randomdog's Soldier CFG

// Notes
// Auto-reload is recommended
// Requires a mouse with at least 4 buttons (unless you feel like rebinding)
// Feel free to change the binds (down at the bottom) but don't mess with the rest unless you know what you're doing
// Designed for competitive play so doesn't use any wait commands and has a hotkey for 'medic down'
// Designed for using the equalizer, there is no autoswitch back after hit from the melee because most of the time you will want to run away when you get the equalizer out. Use scrollwheel up and down to switch if you have to.

// Binds

// Mouse 1 - Rocket Launcher

// Mouse 2 - Shotgun or Activate Buff Banner (will have no effect when gunboats equipped)

// Mouse 3 - Equalizer/Shovel - will stay out if you let go of the button so that you can run away with equalizer. Clicking M3 makes you attack with it.

// Mouse 4 - Instant rocket jump - YOU MUST HAVE THE ROCKET LAUNCHER OUT

// Mouse Wheel up - Switch to rocket launcher

// Mouse Wheel down - Switch to shotgun

// F - 'Medic Down' in team chat and shout the 'go go go' voice command
